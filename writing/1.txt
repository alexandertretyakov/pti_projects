Chapter One --> THE CYCLONE
    Little Dorothy lived on the great Kansas prairie. She lived with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em. Uncle Henry was a farmer. Aunt Em was his wife. Their house was very small. It had only one room. There were not many things in it. There was a table, a cupboard, three or four chairs and the beds.
    Near the house there were neither trees nor flowers. On the right and on the left there was only the great grey Kansas prairie. Even the grass was not green but grey.
    Uncle Henry and Aunt Em worked all day. They never laughed. They had no time to laugh. They began to work early in the morning and stopped late in the evening.
